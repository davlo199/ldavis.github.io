I am a second-year Statistics Ph.D. student at Stanford currently working with Professor [Guenther Walther](https://gwalther.su.domains) on change-point detection and multiscale statistics.

Prior to the Ph.D., I was a Master's Student, and then Research Assistant funded by the Royal Society of New Zealand Marsden Fund, at the University of Otago advised by Professors [Boris Baeumer](https://www.otago.ac.nz/staff-profiles/professor-boris-baeumer) and [Ting Wang](https://www.otago.ac.nz/maths-and-stats/people/ting-wang); I have also collaborated with Dr. Conor Kresin. There, I worked on Hawkes process models for seismicity, and in particular, developed new ``fractional" models which have connections to the geophysical underpinnings of earthquakes (for more please see my research page).

You can contact me at ldavis2[at]stanford[dot]edu.

In my spare time I play the bagpipes and do the sport of weightlifting. Back in New Zealand I also enjoy going fishing in the summer months.
